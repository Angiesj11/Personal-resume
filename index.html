    <h1>Nail Technician</h1>
    
    <h3> A Nail Tech is a proffesional who specializes in the care and beautificaitions of nails. Their work includes Maicures, Pedicures, Nail Art and Nail Shaping. A Nail tech often works at a Nail Salon, Spa, or even at home but me personally I will become a Home-Based Nail-Tech. They use many various tools and products to ensure clients nails are healthy and asthetically pleasing. But most of all Nail Techs need to stay updated on the latest trends and techniques in nail care and design.</h3>
