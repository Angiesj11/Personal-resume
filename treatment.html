    <p> Nail Care involves washing the hands, cleaning under the nails and filing any rough edges before applying Acrylics or polish. Be gentle until the acrylic is fully hardened. Advise your client to be gentle with their acrylic nails for the first 24-48 hours. When you remove your acrylics keep your nails hydrated and nourished with cuticle oil , avoiding harsh chemicals and excessive filing , and giving your nails a break from acrylics because your nails become soft and dull after having acrylics.</p>
